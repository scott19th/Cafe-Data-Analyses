# Hospitality Data Analyses

This repositary is to display some of the Python scripts I have created to perform data analyses on a hospitality business.

The business name and all data have been changed for privacy but the files were created to solve real world problems and provide insights to influence future decision making.

These projects include:

**Sankey Diagram** - Using Python to create a visualisation of the company income statement in a sankey diagram

Problem: The company needed a better understanding of the flows of capital in and out of the business.

Soloution: I used Python and the plotly library to create a visulisation of the companies income statement. This involved linking 17 Values accross 13 source nodes and 9 target nodes. I used a custom colour pallet to match company brand colours.

**Popular Products** - Using Python compile sales information from multiple different sources, clean the data and create a pie chart to elequently show the best selling departments on a company level

Problem: The company was able to view best selling departments for each individual unit using their EPOS software but were unable to view best sellers accross the company as a whole.

Soloution: I used Python and the Pandas library to import the multiple sales CSV's from the different cafe units and then compile them into one data frame. Once complete I cleaned the data and used Matplotlib to create a Pie Chart to visulise the analyses.

**Automation of Order Sheets** - Using python to create an engineering soloution to automate the manual process of exporting, sorting online sales orders into both a bakery bake list and drivers delivery sheets.

Problem: The online sales were being exported into a CSV. Each morning an administrator was required to come in early morning to sort the cake orders into a bake list for the bakery team as well as a delivery sheet for the drivers based on the customer Postcodes

Soloution: ......  This enabled us to reduce the start time of the administrator Monday to Friday and remove the need for a administrator to work over the weekend completely which saved an estimated Â£16,744 in labour costs from the busienss
